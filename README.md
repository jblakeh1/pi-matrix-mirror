# pi-matrix-mirror
This art project is a python script I wrote to pull an image from the Raspberry Pi camera, and write it to an RGB matrix without writing files to the SD card. Most of the code was pulled from existing code examples - I couldn't find an example that didn't write to disk, so I decided to post this publicly.
